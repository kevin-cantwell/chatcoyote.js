chatcoyote.js
=============
http://kevin-cantwell.github.com/chatcoyote.js/

A jQuery plugin for including a chatcoyote chat room on your website or blog.

Individual chat rooms may be created for any or all elements on the page. For 
example, you could replace all comment forms on your blog with a persistent chat room.

Note: Chat rooms are currently public and unmoderated. If you don't like what people are saying
in the room, you can only replace it with a different room to start over.
